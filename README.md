## Custom-RDBMS
 A database server written from scratch for my master's database class in Golang and a client for it written in C#. It supports UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, SELECT operations, Indexes, Keys.
 
 This was my first go project and it didn't follow idiomatic go rules as I was trying out the language.
